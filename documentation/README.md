# Carbon Offset Token (C42) System

## Introduction

The CarbonToken42  (C42) system aims to provide a transparent, efficient, and accessible platform for carbon offsetting. By leveraging blockchain technology, we facilitate the creation, verification, and trading of carbon offset tokens, empowering individuals and organizations to contribute to a sustainable future.

## System Overview

The C42 system revolves around the creation and distribution of ERC-20 tokens, each representing a verified carbon offset. The system involves three primary participants:

* **Project Developers:** Organizations or individuals implementing projects that reduce or remove greenhouse gas emissions.
* **Verification Authority (VA):** An independent body responsible for verifying the legitimacy of carbon offset projects and authorizing token minting.
* **Token Holders:** Individuals or organizations purchasing C42 tokens to offset their carbon footprint.

## Token Details

* **Token Name:** Carbon Offset Token (C42)
* **Token Symbol:** C42
* **Token Standard:** ERC-20
* **Decimal Places:** 18 (standard for ERC-20)
* **Token Supply:** Minted upon verification of carbon offset projects.

## Project Developer Process

* **Project Submission:**
    * Project developers submit detailed project proposals to the VA, outlining the project's methodology, expected carbon emission reductions, and sustainability impact.
* **Project Verification:**
    * The VA conducts a thorough review of the project proposal, including on-site inspections and data analysis, to ensure compliance with established carbon offset standards (e.g., Verra, Gold Standard).
* **Offset Calculation:**
    * The VA calculates the verified carbon emission reductions achieved by the project.
* **Token Minting Request:**
    * Upon successful verification, the project developer submits a token minting request to the VA, specifying the number of C42 tokens corresponding to the verified offsets.

## Verification Authority (VA) Role

* **Project Evaluation:**
    * Establish and maintain rigorous evaluation criteria for carbon offset projects.
    * Conduct independent audits and assessments of project proposals.
* **Token Minting:**
    * Upon successful verification, the VA, through a multisignature process, triggers the minting of C42 tokens, transferring them to the project developer's designated wallet.
* **Transparency and Reporting:**
    * Publish regular reports on verified projects and token minting activities.
    * Ensure transparency in the verification process.
* **Retirement process:**
    * Maintain a method for token retirement, and a public record of retired tokens.
* **Multisig Security:**
    * The VA operates using a multisignature wallet, requiring approvals from multiple authorized parties to execute critical functions, such as token minting. This ensures enhanced security and prevents fraudulent activities.

## Token Holder (Buyer) Process

* **Token Purchase:**
    * Token holders can purchase C42 tokens through designated exchanges or directly from project developers.
* **Carbon Offset Claim (Token Burning):**
    * Token holders who wish to claim the carbon offset represented by their C42 tokens must burn (destroy) them. This action permanently removes the tokens from circulation, signifying that the offset has been claimed and cannot be resold or reused.
    * The burning process is recorded on the blockchain, providing a transparent and auditable record of offset utilization.
* **Transparency:**
    * Token holders can verify the origin and legitimacy of their C42 tokens through the blockchain ledger and confirm the successful burning of tokens they have retired.

## Smart Contract Functionality

* **Token Minting:**
    * The smart contract will include a function accessible only to the VA to mint C42 tokens.
* **Token Transfer:**
    * Standard ERC-20 transfer functionality.
* **Token Retirement (Burning):**
    * A function to burn tokens, permanently removing them from circulation. This action registers the retirement on the blockchain, indicating that the associated carbon offset has been claimed and cannot be reused.
* **Verification Data:**
    * The smart contract will contain, or link to, data verifying the projects that the tokens represent.

## Technology Stack

* **Blockchain:** Ethereum
* **Smart Contract Language:** Solidity
* **Token Standard:** ERC-20
